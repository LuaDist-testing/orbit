Orbit 2.0.2
http://orbit.luaforge.net/

Orbit is an MVC web framework for Lua. The design is inspired by lightweight
Ruby frameworks such as Camping. It completely abandons the CGILua model
of "scripts" in favor of applications, where each Orbit application can fit
in a single file, but you can split it into multiple files if you want.
All Orbit applications follow the WSAPI protocol, so they currently work with
Xavante, CGI and Fastcgi. It includes a launcher that makes it easy to launch
a Xavante instance for development.

Download and Installation

Download and Installation

The easiest way to download and install Orbit is via LuaRocks. You can install Orbit
with a simple command:

luarocks install orbit

Go to the path where LuaRocks put Orbit to see the sample apps and this documentation.
LuaRocks will automatically fetch and install any dependencies you don't already have.

You can also get Orbit from LuaForge. Installing in Unix-like systems is done by
"configure && make && make install", but you have to install any dependencies (such as WSAPI and Xavante) yourself.

To run the supplied example, go to the samples directory
of this distribution and do:

orbit hello.lua

After the server is running go to your web browser. Some sample
urls for hello.lua:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/ will show "Hello World!"
http://127.0.0.1:8080/say/foo will show "Hello foo!"
http://127.0.0.1:8080/anythingelse will show "Not found!"
