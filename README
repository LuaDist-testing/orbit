Orbit is an MVC web framework for Lua.
The design is inspired by lightweight Ruby frameworks such as Camping.
It completely abandons the current CGILua model of "scripts" in favor of applications,
where each Orbit application can fit in a single file, but you can split it into
multiple files if you want.
All Orbit applications follow the WSAPI protocol, so currently work with Xavante,
CGI and Fastcgi. It includes a launcher that makes it easy to launch a Xavante
instance for development.

Installation:

Make sure your Lua interpreter is called lua51 and it is in
your path, then do:

configure
make all
make install

You may have to do the last step as root.

To run the supplied example, go to the samples directory
of this distribution and do:

orbit hello.lua

After the server is running go to your web browser. Some sample
urls for hello.lua:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/ will show "Hello World!"
http://127.0.0.1:8080/say/foo will show "Hello foo!"
http://127.0.0.1:8080/anythingelse will show "Not found!"
